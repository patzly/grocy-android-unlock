[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)  [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/patzly/grocy-android-unlock?label=Release)](https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android-unlock/releases)  [![APK Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/patzly/grocy-android-unlock/total.svg?label=APK%20Downloads)](https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android-unlock/releases)

This app is part of the app [Grocy Android](https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android/), an open-source Android client for [Grocy](https://grocy.info/) ([source code](https://github.com/grocy/grocy)). Grocy is a self-hosted groceries & household management solution for your home.

Grocy Android uses Grocy's official API to provide you a beautiful interface on your phone with powerful barcode scanning and intuitive batch processing, all what you need to efficiently manage your groceries.

Grocy Android has two barcode scanners included, ZXing and ML Kit.

<b>Advantages of ML Kit over ZXing:</b>

- Uses machine learning
- Super-fast scanning
- Latest technologies
- Almost no false results
- Orientation of barcodes does not matter
- Even works with fuzzy or low contrast barcodes

To use ML Kit, you need to install this unlock app. This requires either a one-time purchase on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.zedler.patrick.grocy.unlock) or downloading the APK on the release page here on GitHub. Why we have made this decision?

**You can enjoy Grocy Android completely ad-free. This means that I have not received anything for my work so far. However, because the development takes a lot of time, work and motivation, I would be very happy if you buy the unlock app. Surely the earned money does not reflect the effort, but I'm motivated to further improve the app!  
There would also be donations, that's true. Unfortunately, Google prohibits any form of payment if there is no service in return. That's why I have included this unlock feature.**

If you don't want to support me, you can download the unlock app for free here on GitHub. Grocy Android and the unlock app are open source and will remain so forever.

Let's go, thanks in advance!  
Patrick Zedler

You need at least Grocy Android v2.0.0 for the unlocking feature to work.

## Download

**I understand that it's easier to download the unlock app for free on GitHub. However, I'd love to see you purchase it on Google Play to support my work!**
